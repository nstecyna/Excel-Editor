# Inventory-Editor
A Python program that uses OpenPyXL to edit Excel files, specifically made for inventory sheets.

The program is an easier way to go through inventory excel sheets by listing the item names, the previous inventory count for each item, and allows the user to save items for a second run-through to make it easier to look for specific items after inputting the items the user was ready with.
